# Open Source Vulnerability Schema

> The Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) schema provides a human and machine readable data format to describe vulnerabilities in a way that precisely maps to open source package versions or commit hashes. 

This is the repository for the Open Source Vulnerability schema (OSV Schema), which is currently exported by:
