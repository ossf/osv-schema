  "description": "Versions of `mixin-deep` prior to 2.0.1 or 1.3.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `mixinDeep` function fails to validate which Object properties it updates. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you are using `mixin-deep` 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later.\nIf you are using `mixin-deep` 1.x, upgrade to version 1.3.2 or later.",
