# Purpose

There are many problems to solve industry-wide concerning vulnerability
detection, tracking, and response. One low-level problem is that there are many
databases and no standard interchange format. A client that wants to aggregate
information from multiple databases must handle each database completely
separately. Databases that want to exchange information with each other must
also each have their own parser for each format. Systematic tracking of
dependencies and collaboration between vulnerability database efforts is
hampered by not having a common interchange format. See our
[blog post](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/announcing-unified-vulnerability-schema.html) for more details.

This document defines a draft of a standard interchange format.
We hope to define a format that all vulnerability databases can export, to make
it easier for users, security researchers, and any other efforts to consume all
available databases. Use of this format would also make it easier for the
databases themselves to share or cross-check information.

This shared interchange format is not expected to be the internal format for any
particular database. We hope only that every vulnerability database will make
its entries available in this format to enable interoperability.

The idea for this format originally arose from discussions between the [Go
vulnerability database](https://golang.org/design/draft-vulndb) team and the
[OSV](https://osv.dev) team.

This format is stable, but further backwards compatible changes may still be made.
Feedback from maintainers of other vulnerability databases and security response teams
is most welcome. Please feel free to create an
[issue in this repo](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/issues/new).

# Format Overview

The format is a JSON-based encoding format, using the following informal schema.
The exact details of each field are elaborated in the next section. All strings
contain UTF-8 text.

A JSON Schema for validation is also available
[here](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/blob/main/validation/schema.json).

```json
{
	"schema_version": string,
	"id": string,
	"modified": string,
	"published": string,
	"withdrawn": string,
	"aliases": [ string ],
	"related": [ string ],
	"summary": string,
	"details": string,
	"severity": [ {
		"type": string,
		"score": string
	} ],
	"affected": [ {
		"package": {
			"ecosystem": string,
			"name": string,
			"purl": string
		},
		"severity": [ {
			"type": string,
			"score": string
		} ],
		"ranges": [ {
			"type": string,
			"repo": string,
			"events": [ {
				"introduced": string,
				"fixed": string,
				"last_affected": string,
				"limit": string
			} ],
			"database_specific": { see description }
		} ],
		"versions": [ string ],
		"ecosystem_specific": { see description },
		"database_specific": { see description }
	} ],
	"references": [ {
		"type": string,
		"url": string
	} ],
	"credits": [ {
		"name": string,
		"contact": [ string ],
		"type": string
	} ],
	"database_specific": { see description }
}
```

Again, this document is only about the JSON encoding the database serves to
consumers, which could be applications or other databases. A database might
store its entries in an entirely different format, or it might store them using
this schema but in a more human-editable encoding, such as TOML or YAML. For
serving, only the JSON encoding format is allowed,
not a transliteration into any other encoding.

Overall, the approach of this schema is to define only the fields that
absolutely must be shared between databases, leaving customizations to the
"ecosystem_specific" and "database_specific" blocks (see below)

# Field Details

## schema_version field

```json
{
	"schema_version": string
}
```

The `schema_version` field is used to indicate which version of the OSV schema
a particular vulnerability was exported with. This can help consumer applications
decide how to import the data for their own systems and offer some protection
against future breaking changes. The value should be a string matching the OSV
Schema version, which follows the [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org) format, with
no leading "v" prefix. If no value is specified, it should be assumed to be `1.0.0`,
matching version 1.0 of the OSV Schema. Clients can assume that new minor and patch
versions of the schema only add new fields, without changing the meaning of old
fields, so that a client that knows how to read version 1.2.0 can process data
identifying as schema version 1.3.0 by ignoring any unexpected fields.

## id, modified fields

```json
{
	"id": string,
	"modified": string
}
```

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the vulnerability entry. It is a
string of the format `<DB>-<ENTRYID>`, where `DB` names the database and
`ENTRYID` is in the format used by the database. For example: "OSV-2020-111",
"CVE-2021-3114", or "GHSA-vp9c-fpxx-744v".

The defined database prefixes and their "home" databases are:

| Prefix | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `A` | The [Android vulnerability database](TODO). Serving the shared format [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/android-osv/). |
| `GO` | The [Go vulnerability database](https://github.com/golang/vulndb). Serving the shared format [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/go-vulndb/). |
| `OSV` | The <https://osv.dev> vulnerability database. Serving `<ID>` in the shared format at `https://api.osv.dev/v1/vulns/<ID>` |
| `PYSEC` | The [PyPI vulnerability database](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-db). Serving `<ID>` in the shared format at `https://api.osv.dev/v1/vulns/<ID>` |
| `RUSTSEC` | [The Rust crates vulnerability database](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db). Serving `<ID>` in the shared format at  `https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/osv/crates/<ID>.json` |
| `GSD` | The GSD database. Serving the shared format [here](https://github.com/cloudsecurityalliance/gsd-database). |
| `GHSA` | The GitHub Security Advisory database. Serving the shared format [here](https://github.com/github/advisory-database). |
| `LBSEC` | The LoopBack Advisory Database. Serving the shared format [here](https://github.com/loopbackio/security/tree/main/advisories). |
| `DSA`/`DLA`/`DTSA` | The [Debian Security Advisory](https://www.debian.org/security/) database. Serving the shared format [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/debian-osv/dsa-osv/). |
| `RLSA`/`RXSA` | The [Rocky Linux Security Advisory](https://errata.rockylinux.org) database. Serving the shared format [here](https://apollo.build.resf.org/api/v3/osv/)
| Your database here | [Send us a PR](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/compare). |

In addition to those prefixes, other databases may serve information about
non-database-specific prefixes. For example a language ecosystem might decide to
use CVE identifiers to index its database rather than a custom prefix. The known
databases operating without custom identifier prefixes are:

- Alpine Security Advisory. Serving `<ID>` in the shared format at `https://storage.googleapis.com/cve-osv-conversion/osv-output/<ID>.json`.
- Your database here. [Send us a PR](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/compare).

The `modified` field gives the time the entry was last modified, as an
RFC3339-formatted timestamp in UTC (ending in "Z"). Given two
different entries claiming to describe the same `id` field, the one with the
later modification time is considered authoritative.

The `id` and `modified` fields are required. For schema versions above 1.0.0,
the `schema_version` field is also required. All other fields are optional,
although of course an entry with no other metadata is not particularly useful.
(It could potentially stand for a reserved ID with no other public information.)

## published field

```json
{
	"published": string
}
```

The `published` field gives the time the entry should be considered to have been
published, as an RFC3339-formatted time stamp in UTC (ending in "Z").

## withdrawn field

```json
{
	"withdrawn": string
}
```

The `withdrawn` field gives the time the entry should be considered to have been
withdrawn, as an RFC3339-formatted timestamp in UTC (ending in "Z"). If the
field is missing, then the entry has not been withdrawn. Any rationale for why
the vulnerability has been withdrawn should go into the summary text.

## aliases field

```json
{
	"aliases": [ string ]
}
```

The `aliases` field gives a list of IDs of the same vulnerability in other
databases, in the form of the `id` field. This allows one database to claim that
its own entry describes the same vulnerability as one or more entries in other
databases. Or if one database entry has been deduplicated into another in the
same database, the duplicate entry could be written using only the `id`,
`modified`, and `aliases` field, to point to the canonical one.

## related field

```json
{
	"related": [ string ]
}
```

The `related` field gives a list of IDs of closely related vulnerabilities, such
as the same problem in alternate ecosystems.

## summary, details fields

```json
{
	"summary": string,
	"details": string
}
```

The `summary` field gives a one-line, English textual summary of the
vulnerability. It is recommended that this field be kept short, on the order of
no more than 120 characters.

The `details` field gives additional English textual details about the
vulnerability.

The `summary` field is plain text.

The `details` field is CommonMark markdown (a subset of GitHub-Flavored
Markdown). Display code may at its discretion sanitize the input further, such
as stripping raw HTML and links that do not start with http:// or https://.
Databases are encouraged not to include those in the first place. (The goal is
to balance flexibility of presentation with not exposing vulnerability database
display sites to unnecessary vulnerabilities.)

## severity field

```json
{
	"severity": [ {
		"type": string,
		"score": string
	} ]
}
```

The `severity` field is a JSON array that allows generating systems to describe
the severity of a vulnerability using one or more quantitative scoring methods.
Each `severity` item is a JSON object specifying a `type` and `score` property,
described below.

### severity[].type field

The `severity[].type` property must be one of the types defined below, which
describes the quantitative method used to calculate the associated `score`.

| Severity Type | Score Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `CVSS_V2` | A CVSS vector string representing the unique characteristics and severity of the vulnerability using a version of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System notation](https://www.first.org/cvss/v2/) that is == 2.0 (e.g.`"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:C"`).|
| `CVSS_V3` | A CVSS vector string representing the unique characteristics and severity of the vulnerability using a version of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System notation](https://www.first.org/cvss/) that is >= 3.0 and < 4.0 (e.g.`"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"`).|
| Your quantitative severity type here. | [Send us a PR](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/compare). |

### severity[].score field

The `severity[].score` property is a string representing the severity score based
on the selected `severity[].type`, as described above.

## affected fields

```json
{
	"affected": [ {
		"package": {
			"ecosystem": string,
			"name": string,
			"purl": string
		},
		"severity": [ {
			"type": string,
			"score": string
		} ],
		"ranges": [ {
			"type": string,
			"repo": string,
			"events": [ {
				"introduced": string,
				"fixed": string,
				"limit": string
			} ]
		} ],
		"versions": [ string ],
		"ecosystem_specific": { see description },
		"database_specific": { see description }
	} ]
}
```

The `affected` field is a JSON array containing objects that describes the
affected package versions, meaning those that contain the vulnerability.

Within each object in the `affected` array, the `package` field identifies the
package containing the vulnerability. In most cases, there should be exactly one
entry in the `affected` array per affected `package` to describe all affected
versions. In rare cases, for example if the `ecosystem_specific` encodes
platform information that doesn't apply equally to all listed versions and
ranges, a separate entry with the same `package` in the `affected` array may be
needed.

The `versions` field can enumerate a specific set of affected versions, and the
`ranges` field can list ranges of affected versions, under a given defined
ordering. **A version is considered affected if it lies within any one of the
ranges or is listed in the versions list.** Pseudocode for evaluating if a
given version is affected is available [here](#evaluation).

The `versions` list is generally recommended to always be present, to allow
software to easily answer the question "is this specific version affected?"
without having to contain code specific to every different ecosystem. If the
affected versions can be accurately summarized by one or more non-overlapping
ranges, they may be encoded using the `ranges` field with an appropriate type
(see below). In this case, the ranges act as a kind of compact form of a larger
`versions` list. Tooling and infrastructure such as https://osv.dev are able to
expand these ranges for supported ecosystems into the `versions` list for easier
consumption. Products or ecosystems that do not use version identifiers that can
be represented as ranges must include the enumerated `versions` list instead.

### affected[].package field

The `affected` object's `package` field is a JSON object identifying the
affected code library or command provided by the package. The object itself has
two required fields, `ecosystem` and `name`, and an optional `purl` field.

The `ecosystem` identifies the overall library ecosystem. It must be one of the
strings in the table below. The `name` field is a string identifying the library
within its ecosystem. The two fields must both be present, because the
`ecosystem` serves to define the interpretation of the `name`.

The `purl` field is a string following the
 [Package URL specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) that
identifies the package. This field is optional but recommended.

Different ecosystems can define the same names; they identify different
packages. For example, these denote different libraries with different sets of
versions and different potential vulnerabilities:

```json
{"ecosystem": "npm", "name": "zlib"}
```

```json
{"ecosystem": "PyPI", "name": "zlib"}
```

The defined ecosystems are:

| Ecosystem | Description  |
| --------- |-----------------|
| `Go` | The Go ecosystem; the `name` field is a Go module path.  |
| `npm` | The NPM ecosystem; the `name` field is an NPM package name.  |
| `OSS-Fuzz` | For reports from the OSS-Fuzz project that have no more appropriate ecosystem; the `name` field is the name assigned by the OSS-Fuzz project, as recorded in the submitted fuzzing configuration.  |
| `PyPI` | the Python PyPI ecosystem; the `name` field is a [normalized](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/#normalized-names) PyPI package name.  |
| `RubyGems` | The RubyGems ecosystem; the `name` field is a gem name.  |
| `crates.io` | The crates.io ecosystem for Rust; the `name` field is a crate name.  |
| `Packagist` | The PHP package manager ecosystem; the `name` is a package name.  |
| `Maven` | The Maven Java package ecosystem. The `name` field is a Maven package name.  |
| `NuGet` | The NuGet package ecosystem. The `name` field is a NuGet package name.  |
| `Linux` | The Linux kernel. The only supported `name` is `Kernel`. |
| `Debian` | The Debian package ecosystem; the `name` is the name of the source package. The ecosystem string might optionally have a `:<RELEASE>` suffix to scope the package to a particular Debian release. `<RELEASE>` is a numeric version specified in the [Debian distro-info-data](https://debian.pages.debian.net/distro-info-data/debian.csv). For example, the ecosystem string "Debian:7" refers to the Debian 7 (wheezy) release.  |
| `Alpine` | The Alpine package ecosystem; the `name` is the name of the source package. The ecosystem string must have a `:v<RELEASE-NUMBER>` suffix to scope the package to a particular Alpine release branch (the `v` prefix is required). E.g. `v3.16`. |
| `Hex` | The package manager for the Erlang ecosystem; the `name` is a Hex package name.  |
| `Android`  | The Android ecosystem; the `name` field is the Android component name that the patch applies to, as shown in the [Android Security Bulletins](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin) such as `Framework`, `Media Framework` and `Kernel Component`. The exhaustive list of components can be found at the [Appendix](#android-ecosystem-components). |
| `GitHub Actions` | The GitHub Actions ecosystem; the `name` field is the action's repository name with owner e.g. `{owner}/{repo}`. |
| `Pub` | The package manager for the Dart ecosystem; the `name` field is a Dart package name. |
| `ConanCenter` | The ConanCenter ecosystem for C and C++; the `name` field is a Conan package name.  |
| `Rocky Linux` | The Rocky Linux package ecosystem; the `name` is the name of the source package. The ecosystem string might optionally have a `:<RELEASE>` suffix to scope the package to a particular Rocky Linux release. `<RELEASE>` is a numeric version.
| Your ecosystem here. | [Send us a PR](https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/compare). |

It is permitted for a database name (the DB prefix in the `id` field) and an
ecosystem name to be the same, provided they have the same owner who can make
decisions about the meaning of the `ecosystem_specific` field (see below).

### affected[].severity field

The `severity` field is an optional element [defined here](#severity-field). 
This `severity` field applies to a specific package, in cases where affected 
packages have differing severities for the same vulnerability. If any package 
level `severity` fields are set, the top level [`severity`](#severity-field) 
must not be set. 

### affected[].versions field

The `affected` object's `versions` field is a JSON array of strings. Each string
is a single affected version in whatever version syntax is used by the given
package ecosystem.

### affected[].ranges[] field

The `affected` object's `ranges` field is a JSON array of objects describing the
affected ranges of versions.

### affected[].ranges[].type field

In the `ranges` field, the `type` field is required. It specifies the type of
version range being recorded and defines the interpretation of the `events`
object's `introduced`, `fixed`, and any type-specific fields.

The defined types and their additional fields are:

- `SEMVER`: The versions `introduced` and `fixed` are semantic versions as defined
by [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org), with no leading "v" prefix. The relation
`u < v` denotes the precedence order defined in [section 11 of SemVer 2.0](https://semver.org/#spec-item-11).
Ranges listed with type `SEMVER` should not overlap: since SEMVER is a strict
linear ordering, it is always possible to simplify to non-overlapping ranges.

  Specifying one or more `SEMVER` ranges removes the requirement to specify an
explicit enumerated `versions` list (see the discussion above).

  Some ecosystems may recommend using SemVer 2.0 for versioning without explicitly
enforcing it. In those cases you should use the `ECOSYSTEM` type instead.

- `ECOSYSTEM`: The versions `introduced` and `fixed` are arbitrary, uninterpreted
strings specific to the package ecosystem, which does not conform to SemVer
2.0’s version ordering.

  It is recommended that you provide an explicitly enumerated `versions` list when
specifying one or more `ECOSYSTEM` ranges, because `ECOSYSTEM` range inclusion
queries may not be able to be answered without reference to the package ecosystem’s
own logic and therefore may not be able to be used by ecosystem-independent
processors. The infrastructure and tooling provided by https://osv.dev also
provides automation for auto-populating the `versions` list based on supported
`ECOSYSTEM` ranges as part of the ingestion process.

- `GIT`: The versions `introduced` and `fixed` are full-length Git commit
  hashes. The repository’s commit graph is needed to evaluate whether a given
  version is in the range. The relation `u < v` is true when commit `u` is a
  (perhaps distant) parent of commit `v`.

  Specifying one or more `GIT` ranges does NOT remove the requirement to specify
an explicitly enumerated `versions` list, because `GIT` range inclusion queries
cannot be answered without access to a copy of the underlying Git repository.

### affected[].ranges[].events fields

The `ranges` object's `events` field is a JSON array of objects. Each object
describes a single version that either:
1. Introduces a vulnerability: `{"introduced": string}`
2. Fixes a vulnerability: `{"fixed": string}`
3. Describes the last known affected version: `{"last_affected": string}`
4. Sets an upper limit on the range being described: `{"limit": string}`

These `events` objects represent a "timeline" of status changes for the affected
package.

The values of "introduced", "fixed", "last_affected" and "limit" are version strings
as defined by the `affected[].ranges[].type` field.

#### Special values

  - `"introduced"` allows a version of the value `"0"` to represent a version that
    sorts before any other version.
  - `"limit"` allows versions containing the string `"*"` to represent "infinity".
    If no limit events are provided, an implicit `{ "limit": "*" }` is assumed to
    exist. Multiple `"limit"` events are allowed in the same range.

#### Requirements

Only **a single type** (either `"introduced"`, `"fixed"`, `"last_affected"`,
`"limit"`) is allowed in each event object. For instance,
`{"introduced": "1.0.0", "fixed": "1.0.2"}` is **invalid**.

Entries in the `events` array can contain either `"last_affected"` or `"fixed"`
events, but not both. It's **strongly recommended** to use `"fixed"` instead of
`"last_affected"` where possible, as it precisely identifies the version which
contains the fix.

There must be at least one `"introduced"` object in the `events` array. While
not required, it's also recommended to keep the `events` array sorted according
to the `affected[].ranges[].type` of the range.

See [examples](#examples) for examples of how to describe affected ranges.

### affected[].ranges[].repo field

The `ranges` object's `repo` field is the URL of the package's code
repository. The value should be in a format that's directly usable as an
argument for the version control system's clone command (e.g. `git clone`).

The `affected` object's `ranges` field is a JSON array of objects, each
describing a single range.  The range object defines the fields `type`,
`events`, `repo`.  `introduced`, `fixed`, and additional type-specific fields as needed.

This field is required if `affected[].ranges[].type` is `GIT`.

### affected[].ranges[].database_specific field

The `ranges` object's `database_specific` field is a JSON object holding
additional information about the range from which the record was obtained. The
meaning of the values within the object is entirely defined by the database and
beyond the scope of this document.

Databases should only use this field to store additional context that may be useful in converting from the OSV
format back into the original database representation. Values in this field
have no effect on the [evaluation algorithm](#evaluation).

### affected[].ecosystem_specific field

The `affected` object's `ecosystem_specific` field is a JSON object holding
additional information about the vulnerability as defined by the ecosystem for
which the record applies. The meaning of the values within the object is
entirely defined by the ecosystem and beyond the scope of this document.

For example, the Go ecosystem includes here information about the affected
functions and which modules the packages were found in, along with severity in
the Go project-specific severity scale.

Note that this is a single field with key "ecosystem_specific", which itself
contains a JSON object with unspecified fields.

### affected[].database_specific field

The `affected` object's `database_specific` field is a JSON object holding
additional information about the vulnerability as defined by the database from
which the record was obtained. The meaning of the values within the object is
entirely defined by the database and beyond the scope of this document.

In general, the canonical database for a particular ecosystem should record its
information in `ecosystem_specific`, allowing other aggregator databases to put
their own summaries in `database_specific`.

For example, databases that add additional information such as computed CVSS
scores for ecosystems that do not provide them could add that information here.

Note that this is a single field with key "database_specific", which itself
contains a JSON object with unspecified fields.

### Evaluation

The algorithm to evaluate if a package `pkg` at version `v` is vulnerable is
given by the `IsVulnerable` function in the pseudocode below:

```python
func IsVulnerable(pkg, v, osv)
  for affected in osv.affected
    if affected.package == pkg
      if IncludedInVersions(v, affected.versions) ||
           IncludedInRanges(v, affected.ranges)
        return true

  return false

func IncludedInVersions(v, versions)
  for version in versions
    if v == version
      return true

  return false

func IncludedInRanges(v, ranges)
  for range in ranges
    if BeforeLimits(v, range)
      vulnerable = false
      for evt in sorted(range.events)
        if evt.introduced is present && v >= evt.introduced
           vulnerable = true
        else if evt.fixed is present && v >= evt.fixed
           vulnerable = false
        else if evt.last_affected is present && v > evt.last_affected
           vulnerable = false

      if vulnerable
        return true

  return false

func BeforeLimits(v, range)
  if no limit events in range.events
    # implicit "*" entry is assumed
    return true

  for evt in range.events
    if evt.limit is present and v < evt.limit
      return true

  return false

```

### Examples
The following expresses that "every possible version is affected".

```json
"ranges": [ {
    "type": "SEMVER",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "0" },
    ]
} ]
```

The following expresses that "everything before `1.0.2`" is affected.

```json
"ranges": [ {
    "type": "SEMVER",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "0" },
      { "fixed": "1.0.2" },
    ]
} ]
```

The following expresses that versions in the SemVer ranges `[1.0.0,
1.0.2)` or `[3.0.0, 3.2.5)` are affected. Everything else is unaffected.

```json
"ranges": [ {
    "type": "SEMVER",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "1.0.0" },
      { "fixed": "1.0.2" },
      { "introduced": "3.0.0" },
      { "fixed": "3.2.5" }
    ]
} ]
```

`"limit"` events are typically not necessary for describing numbered (linear)
version ranges and should not be used. They are more useful for git ranges,
where it has more implications for the evaluation algorithm. Take the following
git commit graph and git range:

![git graph](images/git_graph.png)

```json
"ranges": [ {
    "type": "GIT",
    "repo": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "X" },
      { "fixed": "Y" },
    ]
} ]
```

Without an explicit `limit`, the list of computed affected commits will be `X,
A, B, C, D, E, F`. This is the desired behaviour in most cases.

```json
"ranges": [ {
    "type": "GIT",
    "repo": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "X" },
      { "limit": "Y" },
    ]
} ]
```

If `limit` is set to `Y`, the list of affected commits will be `X, A, B, C`. This
is equivalent to `git rev-list X..Y` (but including `X` and excluding `Y`).
This may be useful if the scope of a vulnerability entry is limited to a small
set of linear branches. Multiple `"limit"` events may be specified for each
branch -- each expands the scope of the git commit graph to cover.

Note that we did not specify a `fixed` event here as `limit` makes it redundant.

## references field

```json
{
	"references": [ {
		"type": string,
		"url": string
	} ]
}
```

The `references` field contains a list of JSON objects describing references.
Each object has a string field `type` specifying the type of reference, and a
string field `url`. The `url` is the fully-qualified URL (including the scheme,
typically "https://") linking to additional information, advisories, issue
tracker entries, and so on about the vulnerability itself. The `type` specifies
what kind of reference the URL is.

The known reference `type` values are:

- `ADVISORY`: A published security advisory for the vulnerability.
- `ARTICLE`: An article or blog post describing the vulnerability.
- `REPORT`: A report, typically on a bug or issue tracker, of the vulnerability.
- `FIX`: A source code browser link to the fix (e.g., a GitHub commit) Note that
  the `fix` type is meant for viewing by people using web browsers.  Programs
  interested in analyzing the exact commit range would do better to use the
  `GIT`-typed `affected[].ranges` entries (described above).
- `PACKAGE`: A home web page for the package.
- `EVIDENCE`: A demonstration of the validity of a vulnerability claim, e.g.
	`app.any.run` replaying the exploitation of the vulnerability.
- `WEB`: A web page of some unspecified kind.

## credits fields

```json
{
	"credits": [ {
		"name": string,
		"contact": [ string ],
		"type": string,
	} ]
}
```

The `credits` field is a JSON array providing a way to give credit for the
discovery, confirmation, patch, or other events in the life cycle of a
vulnerability.

Each of the objects in the `credits` array must contain at minimum a `name` field
specifying the name of the individual or entity being credited, using whatever
notation they prefer. It can also optionally include a `contact` JSON array.

### credits[].name field

`credits[].name` should specify the name, label, or other identifier of the
individual or entity being credited, using whatever notation the creditor prefers.
For instance, this could contain a real name like `Kovács János`, an Internet handle
like `erikamustermann`, an entity name like `GitHub`, or something else. This field
is required for each `credits` entry.

### credits[].contact[] field

Each `credits[].contact[]` entry should be a valid, fully qualified, plain-text URL
at which the credited can be reached. Providing contacts is optional.

### credits[].type field

The optional `credits[].type` field should specify the type or role of the
individual or entity being credited. It must be one of the following defined
credit types:

- `FINDER`: identified the vulnerability.
- `REPORTER`: notified the vendor of the vulnerability to a CNA.
- `ANALYST`: validated the vulnerability to ensure accuracy or severity.
- `COORDINATOR`: facilitated the coordinated response process.
- `REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER`: prepared a code change or other remediation plans.
- `REMEDIATION_REVIEWER`: reviewed vulnerability remediation plans or code changes for effectiveness and completeness.
- `REMEDIATION_VERIFIER`: tested and verified the vulnerability or its remediation.
- `TOOL`: names of tools used in vulnerability discovery or identification.
- `SPONSOR`: supported the vulnerability identification or remediation activities.
- `OTHER`: any other type or role that does not fall under the categories described above.

These values and their definitions correspond directly to the credit types defined in the
[MITRE CVE specification](https://cveproject.github.io/cve-schema/schema/v5.0/docs/#collapseDescription_oneOf_i0_containers_cna_credits_items_type).

#### Examples

Including a URL and an email address in `credits[].contact[]` and a credit type:

```json
{
	"credits": [ {
		"name": "Janina Kowalska",
		"contact": [
			"https://twitter.com/JaninaKowalska01",
			"mailto:nina@kowalska-family.net"
		],
		"type": "REMEDIATION_DEVELOPER",
	} ]
}
```

## database_specific field

The top-level `database_specific` field is a JSON object holding additional
information about the vulnerability as defined by the database from which the
record was obtained. The meaning of the values within the object is entirely
defined by the database and beyond the scope of this document.

Unlike the `affected[].database_specific` field which is specific to each
affected product, this top-level field allows aggregator databases to add
custom data that they considered applicable to the whole vulnerability.

Note that this is a single field with key "database_specific", which itself
contains a JSON object with unspecified fields.

# Change Log

- 2021-03-29 added "withdrawn" field
- 2021-04-07 changed "details" to Markdown, change "references" to a list of
  objects with a new "type" field in addition to the URL.
- 2021-04-23 handful of changes, see Status - 2021-04-23 below for details. Corrected examples.
- 2021-04-26 changed `database-specific` and `ecosystem-specific` to
  `database_specific` and `ecosystem_specific` for easier access from languages
  that access JSON field keys using x.field notation.
- 2021-06-08 Added "purl" to the "package" field and some minor clarifications.
- 2021-06-30 Fixed an incorrect/typoed specification for "affects" from an array

  `database_specific` to `affected[].ranges[]`.
  Context: https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/issues/35.
- 2023-02-21 Released version 1.4.0. Added per package `severity` and 
  credit types. 

## Status - 2021-04-07

The unresolved open issues boil down to what the use case is for this data.

The use case we had in mind was enabling computer processing of
vulnerability databases, so that for example:

A web site can display information about a vulnerability fetched from an unaffiliated database.
A security researcher can fetch precise info about which versions are vulnerable for offline analysis.
A vulnerability-checking tool can check a build manifest against a collection of these entries to see which are included in the build and then report a summary.

The vision we had for this was that the same underlying vulnerability might be
described by multiple databases. We wanted a way for databases to be able to
cross-link with each other and understand what the others were publishing.  

See also the "Goal: Standard Schema for Vulnerability Databases" section in
https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/know-prevent-fix-framework-for-shifting.html,
which I’ll quote here:

> Goal: Standard Schema for Vulnerability Databases

> Infrastructure and industry standards are needed to track and maintain open
> source vulnerabilities, understand their consequences, and manage their
> mitigations. A standard vulnerability schema would allow common tools to work
> across multiple vulnerability databases and simplify the task of tracking,
> especially when vulnerabilities touch multiple languages or subsystems.

It was a non-goal to unify the entries in different existing databases into a
single entry for a particular vulnerability.

The open issues that remain seem to be pushing toward a new use case, which is
to be able to unify the entries in different existing databases into a single
entry (for a particular vulnerability). That was a non-goal: the assumption is
that there will always be multiple databases, because at the least each
ecosystem will have its own database with its own custom metadata that doesn't
really make sense to other databases.

The open issue for "delete severity" illustrates this. If you are only
collecting info from an ecosystem's database, it probably does help to be able
to find out what that ecosystem calls the severity of the vulnerability. But
obviously if you are trying to provide a one-true-entry, then it's not going to
make sense to have a global idea of severity.

The open issue for being able to give the affected versions across multiple
ecosystems also illustrates this. If each ecosystem has its own database and
suppose there is a Rust TLS library with a vulnerability and a Go wrapper of
that library, then you'd have two entries: one in the Go database and one in the
Rust database. There's no need to try to put the Rust and Go versions into a
single entry. Both entries could mention the other in "aliases", and maybe
they'd both also list the same CVE in "aliases" as well. On the other hand if
the goal is to define a "one true entry" then obviously you do need to be able
to make the affected versions per-ecosystem, along with potentially most of the
other fields.

For the purpose of discussion, I assert that "one true entry" is still a
non-goal for this schema and that aggregators can easily separate out "affected
Rust versions" and "affected Go versions" from the two entries. I'm skeptical
about a single global database both because of the overhead of coordination (it
bogs down as more and more ecosystems get involved) and how much harder it makes
it to customize and experiment on a per-ecosystem basis. I think there's still a
lot to learn about what we want from these databases, and a more distributed,
federated model makes more sense to me.

Do people think that's a mistake? Does someone want to make the counter-argument
that we should expand the scope to being able to define the entries in a single
global database?

Thanks.

## Status - 2021-04-23

Affected versions. I added more explanatory text to the discussion of the
affected field, to make clear what is expected as far as ecosystem-specific
encodings of ranges. I also added a new `ECOSYSTEM` range type.

Non-unique database prefixes. I changed the discussion in "id, modified" to
handle the case of databases that decide to use identifiers drawn from some
larger space, such as a language that only issues CVE numbers, not its own
identifiers.

Multi-ecosystem vulnerabilities. There was an open issue, discussed at length in
the previous status update, about whether to be able to capture a vulnerability
in multiple ecosystems in a single report. As noted in the previous update,
attempting to do that seems like it introduces unnecessary coordination problems
while also calling into question literally every top-level field that might now
have to be duplicated for each ecosystem. That is, even the description may need
to be tailored for each ecosystem, meaning that the new multi-ecosystem format
ends up being a map from ecosystem to the current format. At that point, it’s
indistinguishable from multiple current-format records.

Also, it appears that even GHSA uses distinct entries for the same CVE from
different ecosystems. For example, CVE 2019-8331 in Bootstrap is both
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fxwm-579q-49qq (nuget) and
https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wh77-3x4m-4q9g (npm).

Similarly, the example I happened to pick for NPM above was assigned
SNYK-JS-ELLIPTIC-1064899 but has the related entry
SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1069836 for that code vendored into the Java world.

I’ve resolved the open issue in favor of single-ecosystem entries rather than
multi-ecosystem entries. Following a suggestion from Robert Schultheis, I added
a "related" list next to "aliases" to capture this kind of close relationship.
I’ve updated the NPM example, which already listed SNYK-JS-ELLIPTIC-1064899 in
"aliases", to list SNYK-JAVA-ORGWEBJARSNPM-1069836 in "related".

Severity. Based on the discussion, removed severity as a top-level field (it is
too ill-specified and not generally interpretable). Databases can provide it as
a database-specific field instead.

Extra. Based on the discussion and general confusion about what belonged here,
split back into two fields: ecosystem-specific and database-specific.

References. Updated the examples to use the new objects with "type" and "url".
Based on that, added some new reference types.

My plan is to rewrite the italicized paragraph at the top of the doc on Monday
and then share the link publicly to gather more feedback from groups that have
not yet seen it.

## Status - 2021-08-24

The biggest change to the schema is our decision to support multiple packages
and ecosystems per entry and the way we specify version ranges.

These changes are primarily in the interests of
supporting better interoperability with other vulnerability schemas, such as the
[CVE JSON schema](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema), where multiple
packages are supported in a single entry. We've also been suggesting other
changes to the CVE schema for better alignment
([1](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/86),
 [2](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/87),
 [3](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/88),
 [4](https://github.com/CVEProject/cve-schema/issues/89)).

Supporting multiple packages is a reversal of our decision back in April (see
"Status - 2021-04-23" for our rationale at the time).

The other major change is the way we specify ranges. Instead of specifying half
open ranges as [introduced, fixed), ranges are encoded with with "events" in a
"timeline" of sorts:

Instead of

```
"ranges": [{
    "type: "GIT",
    "introduced": "058504edd02667eef8fac9be27ab3ea74332e9b4",
    "fixed": "3533e50cbee8ff086bfa04176ac42a01ee3db37d"
}, {
    "type": "GIT",
    "introduced": "058504edd02667eef8fac9be27ab3ea74332e9b4",
    "fixed": "c5157b3e775dac31d51b11f993a06a84dc11fc8c" }
}, {
    "type": "SEMVER",
    "introduced": "1.0.0",
    "fixed": "1.0.2",
}, {
    "type": "SEMVER",
    "introduced": "1.1.0",
    "fixed": "1.1.3",
}]
```

We now have:

```
"ranges": [{
    "type: "GIT",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "058504edd02667eef8fac9be27ab3ea74332e9b4" },
      { "fixed": "3533e50cbee8ff086bfa04176ac42a01ee3db37d" },
      { "fixed": "c5157b3e775dac31d51b11f993a06a84dc11fc8c" }
    ]
}, {
    "type: "SEMVER",
    "events": [
      { "introduced": "1.0.0" },
      { "fixed": "1.0.2" },
      { "introduced": "1.1.0" },
      { "fixed": "1.1.3" }
    ]
}]
```

This avoids repetition with the previous approach and better fits non-linear
versioning schemes like git ranges. We also introduced a "limit" event, which
allows git range specification to be scoped to a small num single branch. This was not
possible before.

These are breaking changes, but we hope to make migration easier by renaming the
"affects" field to "affected" to allow existing consumers and producers of this
data to more easily handle old and new versions of entries.

## Status - 2021-09-08

We've decided to promote our schema to 1.0, based on positive feedback from
existing consumers and producers of this data. From this point on, no backwards
incompatible changes will be made in any 1.x version.

## Android Ecosystem Components

A package name in the `Android` ecosystem indicates the component of Android that the advisory applies to. This matches the component names used in [Android Security Bulletins (ASB)](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin). The complete list of components used in ASB is as follows:

- Framework
- Library
- Media Framework
- System
- Android Runtime
- Kernel
- Kernel LTS
- Android TV
- AMLogic
- ARM
- Broadcom
- FPC
- HTC
- LG
- MediaTek
- Marvell
- NVIDIA
- Qualcomm
- Telecommunication
- Unisoc
- Widevine DRM
